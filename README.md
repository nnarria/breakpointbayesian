# A Bayesian Change Point Analysis of the USD/CLP Series in Chile from 2018-2020: Understanding the Impact of Social Protests and the COVID-19 Pandemic

In this repository it is available the Python implementation for the detection of change points with functional part according to Baragatti, M. et al. (2019) ‘A Bayesian approach for the segmentation of series with a functional effect’, Statistical Modelling, 19(2), pp. 194–220. doi: 10.1177/1471082X18755539. Applied to a simulated series of 100 values, with three change points, and a dictionary of 123 functions with: a constant, 100 Haar functions, 20 Fourier functions, one linear and one quadratic.

Example series with three change points.
